        <p>NBA draftees are getting too smart. It used to be that the annual event's parade of outrageous outfits would provide Twitter 
            comedians with fodder for days: it seemed there was no group of people in the world more hellbent on standing out at all costs, 
            and often with catastrophic results. However, the tide seems to be turning.</p>

        <p>Plenty of last night's hoopers looked great, and if 
            they didn't look great, they simply looked nice. We saw a healthy dose of double-breasted suits, monochromatic suits in muted colors, 
            possibly too much all-black, and an undying commitment to the pendant. Congratulations to these new NBA players: getting drafted is 
            hard, but doing it while looking good has proven over the years to be even more difficult. </p>
